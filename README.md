# 🧠 Student Performance Analysis

A data science project analyzing factors affecting students’ academic performance based on demographics, parental education, and test preparation.

## 📊 Overview
This project explores a dataset of student scores in math, reading, and writing. It highlights how factors like gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation influence performance.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

## 📌 Key Insights
- Students who completed a test preparation course scored significantly higher.
- Parental education correlates positively with student performance.
- Female students outperformed males in reading and writing.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Student_Performance_Analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- `data/`: Contains the dataset
- `visuals/`: Graphs and plots used in the analysis
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies
