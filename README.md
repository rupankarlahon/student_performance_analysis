# Student Performance Analysis

A data science project analyzing factors affecting students’ academic performance based on demographics, parental education, and test preparation.

## Overview
This project explores a dataset of student scores in math, reading, and writing. It highlights how factors like gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation influence performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

## Key Insights
- Students who completed a test preparation course scored significantly higher.
- Parental education correlates positively with student performance.
- Female students outperformed males in reading and writing.

## Project Structure
- `Student_Performance_Analysis.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- `data/`: Contains the dataset
- `visuals/`: Graphs and plots used in the analysis
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies

## Sample Visualizations
![Test Prep vs Reading Score](visuals/test_prep_vs_scores.png)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook

## Future Work
- Add predictive modeling (e.g., classification of pass/fail)
- Deploy insights in a Streamlit dashboard
